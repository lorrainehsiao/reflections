===========

The most challenging portion of this week was getting used to all the different interfaces that were being introduced.  Since I have had little exposure to any programming or computer skills except for R, I felt a little lost as I downloaded everything from github to pidgin to a virtual computer.  Much of the process of completing homework was following listed directions without any coherent understanding of what I was actually doing.  Additionally, some of the directions were not completely clear to me, and I spent a significant amount of time puzzling out instructions.  For example, an instruction when installing the virtual machine such as "Choose all of the default settings when downloading" followed by "Load the program downloaded earlier" was confusing.  Sometimes while following through and choosing the recommended settings, there was also an option to switch the file you wanted to load, and I didn't know if the next instruction to "Load the program downloaded earlier" applied at this stage, or after I was completely finished.  

Google and a fellow classmate provided most of the help in fixing downloading and installation problems.  When I could not figure out how to turn on the BIOS, many forums on google had the solution of pressing "escape" when my computer was starting up.  However, it was only through talking to my classmate that I discovered I was not pressing Esc soon enough, and was not finding the correct screen.  It was also particularly frustrating when programs would not work or open, despite the fact that I tried my best to follow the instructions.  Correcting my mistakes was not easy since neither I nor my friends have a strong understanding of how anything works.  

Additionally, the realization that nothing we do in class (or on the internet for that matter) is private made me think differently about the way information is shared online.  It is true that the data is now more accessible to anyone and everyone who would like to learn and contribute, but the lack of privacy and localness seems strange to me.  It also makes me very wary of what I put online, knowing that whatever I do can be seen by everyone.
