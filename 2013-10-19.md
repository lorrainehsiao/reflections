reflections
===========
This week, we learned some of the formatting for python.  Learning about the syntax was helpful for starting to use python.  However, this would have been more helpful in the beginning of the semester.  It would have also been helpful to do simple assignments in the beginning so that we can utilize python better.  I tried the link to codeacademy and did some of the exercises.  Those were also helpful.  

Professor Stark's lecture was interesting to hear but a bit beyond my level.  I tried taking notes in the beginning but I was unable to keep up.  By the end, I was simply listening to the lecture and trying to understand the concepts.
