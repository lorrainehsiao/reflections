reflections
===========
This week, as part of the break out groups, I was able to get a clearer picture of what we were trying to get done.  I finally discovered the real reason behind why we were doing what we were doing.  Originally, I thought that we were attempting to disprove Luen's method.  The current lack of reproducibility seemed to me the main problem with what Luen had done.  However, after discussing it with some people and hearing from Chris, I discovered that we are actually trying to improbe on Luen's model and prove that a slightly tweaked basic model is better than the very complicated ETAS model.  
The presentor group seemed to work quite well together, and we were willing to work together even after we had figured out our parts.  We were brain storming ideas for how to tweak the Luen model, and everyone was willing to explain things to each other.
