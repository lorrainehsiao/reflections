===========
This week, I feel like things are really coming together for the class, especially in terms of presenting and finishing tasks.  With details being finalized about the science faire in addition to plans about collating the information into a presentation, it is becoming very real.

That said, the past week has been very productive in progressing with the visualizations.  We have preliminary code for visualizing the earthquakes from whatever data frame time period that we put in.  It cuts off for a magnitude below two, since there was too much noise otherwise, and those earthquakes are less relevant to what we are trying to predict.  Any earthquake that is above a magnitude of 4 is then noted and an alarm turned on for it.  We have the MDA model from the analyzers, and we are currently using pseudo parameters just to visualize.  The start times for the alarms are graphed in blue, and the end times are graphed in red.  I have been working with this in R in order to look at the information and see how best to try and visualize it.  Another member of our group is coding it directly in python after knowing what it is that we want to see.  This way, it will be a lot easier to collate as a whole.

Our next steps are to create the error diagrams for the model and see how we want to encapsulate the success rates.  Part of the problem is that we are also deciding when earthquakes stop being considered 'aftershocks' and are their own separate occurrences.  We are also trying to make a moving visualization, and that is in the process.  We are still researching the plausability of this with our limited skills, the deadlines, and figuring out the programming behind it.  Tis all very interesting though.

We are also checking reproducibility of code along the way, and double checking that everything we have follows one of the main purposes of the class.
