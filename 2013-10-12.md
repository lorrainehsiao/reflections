===========
This week I learned firsthand the problems of reproducibility when trying to execute the project.  Our visualizer was using programs in python that the rest of us couldn't run on our computer.  I realized the importance of clarifying the version, or packages used.  Since there is no assumption that people always have the same programs installed, adding them into the directions would help debug certain issues.

Completing the project required a lot of communication, and meeting up was difficult to coordinate within one week amongst four busy college students.  There wasn't a lot of time to plan in between and if someone wasn't checking their email, then it was difficult to sort things out.  

It was also interesting to be able to see what all the other groups were producing.  They all ran into some of the same problems that we did, though the ones that already had coders in the group did not have the issue of first figuring out python.  The language itself wasn't too hard to learn, but difficult to effectively utilize when I had never used it before.

Trying to reproduce other groups' work was also interesting because I encountered difficulties that I had never tried to puzzle out before.  For example, I didn't know how to open an ipython notebook from code.  Or I wasn't sure about how to install and get certain programs that other people were using.
