===========
This past week, hearing guest lectures about Yosemite toads and earthquakes was incredibly cool because I was able to see applicability of statistics to real life.  These were people applying probability models and statistical analysis to real world situations.  

I particularly enjoyed Eric Berlow's talk because it was such a relevant and local case.  He was utilizing statistics to answer a legal question concerning scientific facts.  It gave me a little bit of perspective on how tedious scientific work can sometimes be, though the result often comes out as a simple graph of information on Yosemite Park.

I also liked hearing Philip Stark's lecture on earthquakes because his work and the questions it raises are one that I have often had. For example, some questions that I have had are how to determine in a real world situation whether or not a result is due to chance or not, or how to use probability models to predict something you already have data for.  It also opened my eyes to the difficulties of accurately modelling events.

Lastly, I went to office hours on Friday and was finally able to successfully run ipython notebook.  The procedure took longer than I expected, and gave me new respect for people who can manage and handle computers.
