reflections
===========
This week was incredibly productive for me and everyone in both my horizontal and vertical groups.  As a horizontal group, the presentors met on Monday and were greatly productive in figuring out what each of the groups was doing and how far along they were in the process.  Additionally, it was very productive since we were able to have all of it done in an hour.  I got to know everyone in the presentor group by name and by face, making it very helpful for future communications.  I helped to compile a list of each of the groups and their current statuses and decide where things would go in the future.  Within the meeting, we were also able to clear up many confusing aspects of which groups were passing along information and how they would go about analyzing or visualizing it.

Within the vertical groups, I was able to meet up with them and go to office hours to see what they were doing.  Office hours was a bit helpful in clearing up some of the questions I had about the actual presentations and the work that my group was accomplishing.  I helped put together our SMART goals on the github page and update them on any status reports from the rest of the groups.  As the presentor, I was involved in the process of getting the output of work, running the code, and then delivering it to the class.

My small concern for the work was that since it wasn't done on github but through email, google docs, and in person, that it might be hard to recognize the work and effort I put in.
