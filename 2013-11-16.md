During this past week, I felt that I made a lot of progress in terms of understanding what we were doing, how the project was going, and then completing the tasks at hand.  The idea with the Magnitude Dependent Alarm model makes a lot of sense to me from a statistical standpoint, if we take the amount of time that is one standard deviation from the average.  This will cover (on average) 90% of the earthquakes in that region and warn people up to the cutoff of the number of earthquakes we waited for.  However, I do realize that this idea has limitations depending on what part of the world the analysis is applied to.  Since we are restricting it to the southern California region, the application of this information will be much more specific, and will correspond more accurately to the way the faults are currently situated.  Another concern that I realized was that the more earthquakes we try and capture, the more indefinitely long our alarm will be.  In particular, if we try to capture many more than the usual average of post magnitude 5 alarms, then our alarm time might be highly skewed.

Additionally, I have now (if unofficially) joined a visualizer group since I wanted to take up another task.  The visualizer group has been playing with the output of two of the analyzer groups to intake the data and begin plotting error graphs.  It has been interesting to see the travel of information down the pipeline, and seeing how it must all be curated even after the data curators thought they were mostly done with their task.  Being in a visualizer group made me realize more precisely the information that I would want or need, but that I had not realized as a data curator.  However, it wasn't really a communication problem because the very specific details had to be ironed out as we played with the information.  

It has been great seeing a class that is now pretty much independent work together on the task.  People have linked all the channels of communication, and questions flow easily between people.  There is also no more confusion as to who is who, since we have all met each other by now.  Additionally, it is very easy to ask different groups to take on different tasks and share or edit their information.  People are much more willing to help each other out, and are very considerate about time or work constraints.
