<h3>Reflections</h3>
In class, we discussed the roles of each respective group and what they should be in charge of.  I liked the clarification of each role but was still not too clear about what exactly I was supposed to do.  Since I am the presentor, I discovered that I should be looking at articles and journals to try and provide background/evidence to back up our presentation.  However, since I am not too familiar with serious statistical scientific research, this may prove to be a problem later down the line.  I thought that this class would be more about learning to do a project together instead of separating and delegating roles.  In this way, we are all just limited to our current strengths and we probably won't expand our skill set into the other territories.

I had imagined that we would all learn to use python to analyze data and present.  However, each section is broken off and handed to different groups.  Classes are spent mostly discussing roles and what we plan to do in the future.  Our presentor group decided that each group should be in charge of writing their own section within the report because they know the procedures best.  However, one of us would be in charge of reading through it and making sure there is a flow.  Additionally, we would also be in charge of finding articles to give to each group and then presenting all of it at the end.
