reflections
===========
This week I realized that even though I was previously able to get iPython to work on my computer, there were still snags along the way to getting it working again.  The series of commands to opening up vagrant and other necessary programs is hard to remember.  Even with help, my computer tends to time out and doesn't open the correct programs.  However, even though I got it working by the end of the class period, we didn't actually do anything with it, which was a little sad.

I did like hearing the reasoning for starting this class, and hearing why it was created in the first place.  The issue of reproducibility had never arisen for me, since I did not take part in research based investigations.  I finally have a clear grasp of why we are creating a virtual box and a sterile environment within our computers.  However, I feel that this should have been clear from the very beginning, and a lecture like the one we had on Thursday would have been great as the first or second lecture.
