reflections
===========
This week for class, I appreciated the check-in that the professor did for us.  It allowed us to provide feed back and see what other people in the class were thinking.  I like the idea of having the commands that were used in class uploaded online so we can try things at home.  It also made me realize the difficulties of applying a broad program to everyone's separate computer.  Due to different settings and type, it becomes hard to just give out blanket instructuions that would apply to everyone.

It was also a little frustrating not totally understanding all the things I was downloading in relation to vagrant.  Additionally, I could never get it to completely work, so I feel that I am still will not be prepared when real work gets assigned.
