===========
This week's class was on Tuesday a little confusing because of the distinction between horizontal and vertical groups and no clear direction about what we should be doing with each.  As the presentor group, we tried to be organized and creative but there wasn't much we could think of that was innovative.  We knew about prezi but none of the other html5 platforms.  It would have been nice to have some sort of introduction to these so that we could try to incorporate new ideas in.  It also was not totally clear of the different assignments for the horizontal and vertical group, with the only direction being to "communicate".  There have been many email threads started, but it is quite confusing.

Additionally, it would have been really nice to have some experience with the tools we are using before starting the project.  We never even actually coded in python before we were expected to use it to clean data.  Theresa and I were able to figure some of it out by looking through online resources and translating from code in R, but the resources are a little scattered and hard to use efficiently.  An exercise in python at least as homework would have been a great way to start so that we could begin the homework with a basic knowledge of formatting in python.  

We kept in mind the idea of reproducibility in all of it, and tried to make sure this could be run from anywhere.
