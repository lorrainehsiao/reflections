reflections
===========
Reflecting upon this past week, and in particular filling out the survey, has made me realize the extent to which this class has been collaborative.  Even with everyone being home for Thanksgiving, the role of github served to connect everyone on the same page and keep momentum going.  I realized that even though I had been placed in a presenter group, I was able to take part in almost all the labelled groups (presenter, data curator, visualizer).  The main underlying factor was that they were all based around statistics and our data project, so I could move easily between groups without being very lost in technical details.

As I was working with the data for visualizations, I realized how useful it was to having everything available in an open forum such as github.  I didn't need people to email me data or update dropbox, since it was all available from whenever they had finished it.  There were also resources and links that other classmates were posting that served to be helpful in looking up different ways to visualize what I wanted.

I ran into a few roadblocks as I worked over Thanksgiving.  The first was that I had no readily available access to internet in order to write reflections when I wanted to.  The second was that I couldn't figure out how to put the hours in the earthquake data into a usable time stamp.  The dates were working fine, and I could subtract between them, but I could not append the time and figure out how to subtract between them.  I did have an aha moment when I figured out how to utilize the data tool.  I found that I could asily plot lines for times x days after a quake.  I have been consulting with my group on these issues, and we are working through them together.
